## Test Configuration Files

- `vitest.config.ts` - Vitest configuration
- `playwright.config.ts` - Playwright configuration
- `src/__tests__/setup.tsx` - Test setup and mocks

## Coverage Thresholds

- Branches: 70%
- Functions: 70%
- Lines: 70%
- Statements: 70%

## CI/CD Integration

Tests are configured to run on:

- Pre-commit (linting)
- Pre-push (type checking and tests)
- Pull requests (full test suite)

## Known Issues & TODOs

1. Complete remaining component tests
2. Add more edge case testing
3. Implement visual regression tests
4. Add performance benchmarks
5. Complete API route test coverage
6. Add mutation testing
7. Implement contract testing for external APIs

## Test Data Management

- Test users are created with timestamps
- Cleanup functions remove test data
- Mock data is consistent across test suites

## Best Practices

1. Each test file matches its source file location
2. Tests are isolated and don't depend on each other
3. Mock external dependencies
4. Use data-testid for E2E selectors
5. Test user interactions, not implementation
6. Include accessibility testing
7. Test error states and edge cases
